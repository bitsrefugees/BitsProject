In game notes: 

Player STATS:
	PLayer has three Lives

Dying three times will return you to menu. 

right click will close game at menu

carrots change player speed(duration stacks). Unforutinately due to two group members dropping out we did not have time to create Debuff.
However we will make a slow debuff during extended features.

Lava, spikes, or enemy contact will kill the player and remove one life.
